Hello! I'm Abigail Spigarelli and I am a curiosity and problem solving driven engineer. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to synthesize information and approach stiuations from multiple angles. This applies to all areas of my life, from Climbing to Collages to Computers.

## Professional Experience

I just reached my 6 months mark since I graduated in Computer Science from Brigham Young University and I've already worked a variety of different jobs within the tech space. Research, Cybersecurity, Data Science, DevOps, and Software Engineering are just a couple of jobs and roles I've enjoyed. One of my favorite books is [Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://davidepstein.com/range/), and a career and personal goal of mine is to become the generalist's Epstein describes. I am always excited to work on something new, so please reach out if you have an opportunity!

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer for Leidos.
