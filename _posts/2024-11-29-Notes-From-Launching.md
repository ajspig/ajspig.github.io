## Launching My Personal Website: A Journey

I'm excited to share my new personal website! My first personal website was created in a web programming class. However, after shutting down everything hosted on AWS, it no longer exists. It also had a "clever" name that proved confusing. Was it "abby spig"? Or was it "abby's pig"? Clearly, it was time for a new and improved personal site.

Here’s a quick rundown of why I built the site, the challenges I faced, and what I’d do differently next time.

## Why Build a Personal Website?

I wanted a space to capture and share my thoughts on tech, work, and the processes I’m trying to improve. A personal website offers the freedom to blog and practice my development skills without relying on social media platforms.

It’s also a great way to:
- Share experiences and blog more frequently.
- Showcase my technical skills while keeping maintenance simple and cost-effective.
- Start with something free and straightforward, with room to evolve.

## Choosing the Right Tools

I considered several options before settling on **Jekyll with GitHub Pages**. Here’s why:

- **Free Hosting**: I needed something budget-friendly with room to scale later.
- **Simplicity & Flexibility**: I wanted a simple solution that could grow over time.

After exploring options like plain HTML/CSS, Gatsby, and React, I chose Jekyll because of its ease of use and strong community support.

## What Went Well

- **Theme Choice**: The [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) was an excellent choice. Its clean layout and sidebar are perfect for blogging.
- **Local Development Setup**: Running Jekyll locally made testing changes quick and efficient.
- **GitHub Pages Hosting**: Free, reliable, and easy to set up—perfect for a starting point.

## Challenges & Mistakes

While following GitHub’s [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), I encountered a few hiccups:

1. **Wrong Starting Point**: I initially followed the github tutorial, but it would have been more straightfoward to pick the theme first and start with the theme's specific guide (I used [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/).)
2. **Favicon and Avatar Issues**: I struggled with customizing the favicon and avatar. Ultimately, these challenges taught me a lot about the build process. Lesson learned: Read instructions carefully!
3. **Post File Naming**: I misunderstood how to name posts. Files should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.extension`, but I initially skipped the title part. Lesson learned: Once again read instructions carefully!

## Next Steps

- **Post More Frequently**: Aim for weekly posts summarizing ideas and projects.
- **Update the URL**: Transition to a custom domain like `abigailspigarelli.net`.
- **Add Commenting Abilities**: Encourage reader interaction.
- **Integrate Analytics**: Track site performance and visitor engagement.
- **Refine the Design**: Continue tweaking the layout and visual elements.
- **Explore Backend Components**: Experiment with backend work to enhance the site’s functionality.

## Final Thoughts

Building this site was a great learning experience, and I’m happy with the results. I look forward to iterating on it :)

Thanks for reading! Stay tuned for more updates.
