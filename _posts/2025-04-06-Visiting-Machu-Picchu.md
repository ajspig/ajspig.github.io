## Introduction

Machu Picchu – one of the most iconic travel destinations in the world. You've probably heard about it your whole life, but will it live up to the hype? And what is the true cost of experiencing this 7 Wonder of the World?  
In this blog post, I’ll break down the costs of visiting Machu Picchu from my visit in March 2025. I’ll also share my own experience, what I spent, and what factored into that. By the end, we’ll also take a look at the costs of visiting comparable ruins to see how Machu Picchu stacks up.

## Expenses

Expect at least 1 day for travel to Cusco, and then another day in Machu Picchu. You could at least travel for 3 days and see it. Comfortably do it in a week. I did it in 2 weeks, but the following estimates were provided as if I traveled for 3 days to see Machu Picchu.

### Transportation

Arguably getting to Machu Picchu is the hardest part. I flew from D.C. and got round trip tickets to Lima several months in advance. I also flew from Lima to Cusco. To get from Cusco to Aguas Calientes you can take a multi-day trek along the Inca Trail or use one of two train companies (there are more options if you are a local). Finally, once in Aguas Calientes, you can either take a 2-hour hike mostly alongside the windy road or use the one bus company to reach the Machu Picchu ruins.

**Curious about this transportation monopoly?**  
I found this interesting article about it:  
Purported to be two of the most expensive rail and bus routes per kilometer in the world, the train and bus succession which transports the 1.3 million tourists to Machu Picchu every year has been controlled by a government-granted monopoly for much of the last two decades.

Also, take into consideration that I used a personal item for my whole trip. Didn't pay extra for luggage.

| **Expense**                                    | **Cost (USD)** |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Flight from D.C. to Lima (round trip)          | 382.87         |
| Flight from Lima to Cusco (round trip)         | 69.66          |
| Train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes (round trip)| 136.80         |
| Bus from Aguas Calientes to Machu Picchu ruins (round trip) | 24          |
| Uber/taxi/bus from airport to accommodations in Lima and Cusco | 16      |
| **Total**                                      | **629.33**     |

### Accommodations

I stayed a night in Lima and Cusco before making it to Aguas Calientes. As you can see below, in Aguas Calientes, things are just more expensive because it is a tourist hub. Our accommodations were not only the most expensive the whole trip but also the worst quality (think right by the train station, literally rattles every time the train comes by).

| **Location**          | **Cost (USD)** |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Lima Airbnb           | 11.40          |
| Cusco Hostel          | 9.38           |
| Aguas Calientes Hostel| 12.00          |
| **Total**             | **32.78**      |

### Food

I had a quick turnaround in Cusco after visiting Machu Picchu and didn’t get any food there until the next day. The food in Aguas Calientes was comparable in price to what I paid in Lima, but worse quality.

| **Meal**              | **Cost (USD)** |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Lima Dinner           | 12.01          |
| Lima Breakfast        | 6.00           |
| Lima Lunch            | 13.10          |
| Aguas Calientes Lunch | 10.86          |
| Aguas Calientes Dinner| 1.70           |
| Aguas Calientes Snacks/Water | 10.00   |
| Aguas Calientes Linner (Post Machu Picchu) | 5.63 |
| **Total**             | **59.30**      |

### Machu Picchu

Tickets to Machu Picchu can vary depending on the time you choose to visit. We bought our tickets several weeks in advance since they often sell out. Additionally, there are lots of routes to consider. I bought the traditional 1 route and the route 3 to hike Huayna Picchu. Unfortunately, because of a mudslide a couple of days before that route 3 was closed, they let me use it for any other route of our choosing.

I did end up getting a private guide at the top (which I split with a group of 5 other tourists). But I wouldn't recommend it. I didn’t feel like I learned a lot I could have learned from a Wikipedia page. If I went back, I would be more educated and not use a guide. In my opinion, there are other ways to support the tourism economy when you travel that are just as meaningful.

Also, expect to pay for bathrooms :)

| **Expense**                      | **Cost (USD)** |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Two Time Entry Tickets          | 97.76          |
| Tour Guide (50 soles + 20 soles tip) | 21.88       |
| Bathroom Visit                   | 0.65           |
| **Total**                        | **120.13**     |

## Some Ways to Make it Cheaper

- Skip Lima and travel directly to Cusco (~-20)
- Only do one route at Machu Picchu (-42)
- Do Machu Picchu self-guided (-21.88)
- Hike the Bus route (-24)
- Hike the Inca Rail and skip the Train route (arguably this won’t save any money, since it takes more time and paying your guides)

## Review/Experience

Machu Picchu receives 1.6 million visitors per year. According to the official Machu Picchu Tickets Site, they increase the number of tickets available in their busier months. Since 2024, Machu Picchu authorities have authorized a dynamic capacity in high and low seasons. That is, in the high season, from June 1 to October 15, the maximum daily visitor capacity is 5,600 people. The same applies to holidays such as Christmas (December 25), New Year’s Day (January 1), and Independence Day (July 28). The rest of the year, from October 16 to May 31, the maximum daily capacity is 4,500 people per day.

The least busy months are January, February, and March. However, the rainy season (December through March) can also impact travel, making it more challenging to get to and enjoy Machu Picchu. It impacted our trip, since some of the routes were closed due to mudslides.

Peru had the most number of COVID-19 deaths per capita and case-fatality rate, and this had a significant impact on the tourism industry in Peru as well. Even visiting five years after COVID-19, you still see signage for COVID-19 precautions everywhere.

Machu Picchu was closed for 2 years during COVID and for preservation efforts. There’s been talk about potential closures in the near future for preservation efforts, so if you’ve always wanted to go, you may want to prioritize your trip sooner rather than later.
