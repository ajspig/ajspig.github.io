## Introduction

Machu Picchu – one of the most iconic travel destinations in the world. You've probably heard about it your whole life, but does it live up to the hype? And what is the true cost of experiencing one of the Seven Wonders of the World?

**TLDR:** There are other wonderful ruins besides Machu Picchu. Get out there and explore!

In this blog post, I will try to answer these questions by detailing the expenses (on a budget!) and experience of visiting Machu Picchu and other comparable ruins in March 2025.

### Timing  

When should you go? Machu Picchu receives 1.6 million visitors per year. According to the official Machu Picchu Tickets Site, they increase the number of tickets available during busier months. Since 2024, Machu Picchu authorities have authorized dynamic capacity based on high and low seasons.  

- **High Season:** June 1 to October 15 (and holidays like Christmas, New Year’s Day, and Independence Day - July 28) — up to **5,600 visitors per day**.  
- **Low Season:** October 16 to May 31 — up to **4,500 visitors per day**.

The least busy months are **January, February, and March**, but the **rainy season (December through March)** can impact travel. This affected my trip — a mudslide canceled my Huayna Picchu hike.

Expect to need **at least 3 days** to see Machu Picchu. I spent two weeks in Peru, but the following expenses are for a **three-day** trip (prices in USD):

### Transportation  

Getting to Machu Picchu is the hardest part.  

I flew from D.C. to Lima (round trip), then Lima to Cusco. From Cusco to Aguas Calientes, you can either hike the Inca Trail (multi-day trek) or take a train. Once in Aguas Calientes, you either buy a bus ticket or hike 2 hours to the ruins (mostly along a narrow winding road).  

> **Note:** Flights only included a personal item. Expect to pay $30–$70 more per flight for additional luggage.

| Expense | Cost (USD) |
|--------|------------|
| Flight from D.C. to Lima (round trip) | 382.87 |
| Flight from Lima to Cusco (round trip) | 69.66 |
| Train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes (round trip) | 136.80 |
| Bus from Aguas Calientes to Machu Picchu (round trip) | 24 |
| Uber/taxi/bus to/from airports in Lima and Cusco | 16 |
| **Total** | **629.33** |

---

### Accommodations  

I stayed in Lima and Cusco before reaching Aguas Calientes. Aguas Calientes, being tourist-heavy, had the most expensive and lowest-quality stay (right next to the train station — not ideal).

| Location | Cost (USD) |
|----------|------------|
| Lima Airbnb | 11.40 |
| Cusco Hostel | 9.38 |
| Aguas Calientes Hostel | 12.00 |
| **Total** | **32.78** |

---

### Food  

Peruvian food is incredible! I didn’t eat in Cusco due to timing, but meals in Aguas Calientes were comparable in price to Lima, though lower in quality.

| Meal | Cost (USD) |
|------|------------|
| Lima Dinner | 12.01 |
| Lima Breakfast | 6.00 |
| Lima Lunch | 13.10 |
| Aguas Calientes Lunch | 10.86 |
| Aguas Calientes Dinner | 1.70 |
| Aguas Calientes Snacks/Water | 10.00 |
| Aguas Calientes "Linner" (Post-Machu Picchu) | 5.63 |
| **Total** | **59.30** |

---

### Machu Picchu

I bought tickets weeks in advance. Originally purchased Route 1 and Route 3 (Huayna Picchu hike), but Route 3 was closed due to a mudslide. I joined a group of tourists to split the cost of a guide.

> **Note:** Expect to pay for bathrooms!

| Expense | Cost (USD) |
|---------|------------|
| Two-Time Entry Tickets | 97.76 |
| Tour Guide (with tip) | 21.88 |
| Bathroom Visit | 0.65 |
| **Total** | **120.13** |

---

### Grand Total  

| Category | Total (USD) |
|----------|-------------|
| Transportation | 629.33 |
| Accommodations | 32.78 |
| Food | 59.30 |
| Machu Picchu | 120.13 |
| **Total** | **841.54** |

---

### Some Ways to Make It Cheaper  

- Skip Lima and go directly to Cusco (**~-$20**)  
- Only do one Machu Picchu route (**-$42**)  
- Visit Machu Picchu without a guide (**-$21.88**)  
- Hike instead of using the bus (**-$24**)  
- Hike the Inca Trail (*Note: not cheaper, but a different experience!*)

### What if You’re Already in Peru?

If you’re already planning to visit Lima and Cusco and are considering Machu Picchu, here’s the **additional cost**:

| Expense | Cost (USD) |
|---------|------------|
| Train (Cusco to Aguas Calientes round trip) | 136.80 |
| Bus (Aguas Calientes to Machu Picchu) | 24 |
| Two-Time Entry Tickets | 97.76 |
| Tour Guide | 21.88 |
| Bathroom Visit | 0.65 |
| Food in Aguas Calientes (3 meals) | 30 |
| Accommodations (1 night) | 12 |
| **Total** | **323.09** |

## Experience

*Rainy and Realistic Machu Picchu*

Machu Picchu is breathtaking — even in pouring rain. The terracing is stunning, and slowly sinking under the weight of tourism. The stones are a perfect fit… in some places. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience — **emphasis on once**. I don’t plan to return or take my family. There are equally impressive and less-visited ruins around the world. Machu Picchu checked a bucket list box, but one visit is enough for me.

## Other Comparable Ruins

*Sacsayhuaman in Cusco*

Cusco is surrounded by ruins showcasing beautiful stonework. The **Sacred Valley** to the north offers large, accessible ruins.  

I also loved the ruins in **Colca Canyon**. The towns of **Chivay** and **Yanque** nearby feature stunning Incan ruins — about as remote but far less crowded than Machu Picchu.

## Conclusion

Machu Picchu was closed for two years during COVID and for preservation. There are rumors of future closures, so if it’s on your bucket list — go soon.  

But don’t overlook the other incredible ruins in Peru!
